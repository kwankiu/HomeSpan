# Welcome!

## This is a fork that was modified for [DashHome](https://github.com/DashHome/DashHome)
## I forked it because i would like to test and work on a few features
## I will do this only on my free time, there is no priority which feature will come first and I might never have time to work on this, so dont expect anything.

## Some Ideas/Thoughts :
- Add support for OTA upload through a Web Server
- Create a system log file and output all system logs to web log (useful if you do not have access to the Serial Monitor)
- Print mac address and wifi channel if WifiApAdress is true (for ESP8266 ESPNOW)
- Add ESP-32 HomeKit Camera support
- Add support to use this library for ESP8266
- Create a Web Dashboard (Check out my another project [DashHome](https://github.com/DashHome/DashHome))
- Support to control other Smart Home device (such as Tuya devices) and act as a bridge (Check out my another project [DashHome](https://github.com/DashHome/DashHome))
- Alternative control of accessories (eg Control then through a web dashboard or ESPNOW)

Welcome to HomeSpan - a robust and extremely easy-to-use Arduino library for creating your own [ESP32-based](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/modules/esp32) HomeKit devices entirely within the [Arduino IDE](http://www.arduino.cc).

HomeSpan provides a microcontroller-focused implementation of [Apple's HomeKit Accessory Protocol Specification Release R2 (HAP-R2)](https://developer.apple.com/homekit/specification/) designed specifically for the Espressif ESP32 microcontroller running within the Arduino IDE.  HomeSpan pairs directly to HomeKit via your home WiFi network without the need for any external bridges or components.  With HomeSpan you can use the full power of the ESP32's I/O functionality to create custom control software and/or hardware to automatically operate external devices from the Home App on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac, or with Siri.

HomeSpan requires version 2.0.0 or later of the [Arduino-ESP32 Board Manager](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32), and has been tested up through version 2.0.6 (recommended).  HomeSpan can be run on the original ESP32 as well as Espressif's ESP32-S2, ESP32-C3, and ESP32-S3 chips.

  * Includes three new Characteristic methods: `setData()`, `getData()`, and `getNewData()`
  * Includes new macro `CUSTOM_CHAR_DATA()` to easily create custom byte-array Characteristics
  * See the [API Reference](Reference.md) for details
  
* **LedPin upgrade**
  * New option to invert the PWM signal

# External Resources

In addition to HomeSpan resources, developers who are new to HomeKit programming should download Apple's [HomeKit Accessory Protocol Specification, Release R2 (HAP-R2)](https://developer.apple.com/homekit/specification/). The download is free, but Apple requires you to register your Apple ID for access to the document.

You ***do not*** need to read the entire document.  The whole point of HomeSpan is that it implements all the required HAP operations under the hood so you can focus on just programming whatever logic is needed to control your real-world appliances (lights, fans, RF remote controls, etc.) with the device.  However, you will find Chapters 8 and 9 of the HAP guide to be an invaluable reference as it lists and describes all of the Services and Characteristics implemented in HomeSpan, many of which you will routinely utilize in your own HomeSpan sketches.

### About the Author

HomeSpan was developed and continues to be maintained and supported by Gregg Berman.  It was originally conceived to solve the pesky problem of not being able to operate an RF-controlled kitchen vent hood with Siri.  I hope you find it useful as well as fun to use.

This is my second large-scale open-source project --- my first was the design of an open-source sytem for operating model railroads using nothing more than an Arduino Uno and Arduino Motor Shield to generate digital command and control (DCC) signals.  Though I have not been involved with the model railroading hobby for many years, videos showcasing my original system (dubbed DCC++), along with detailed tutorials of how it works, are still available on the [DCC++ YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@dcc2840/videos).
